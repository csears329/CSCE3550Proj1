these are the AI prompts I used in chatGPT to help create this project:

Can you explain each part of a python RSA Key generation for a beginner in python?

How do I create a FastAPI server in python?

What commands do I run to test the endpoints?

I tried using the curl command and I'm not getting a response

(Several prompts of just me pasting devastatingly long and unreadable error messages/tokens)

How would I test the endpoints with the expired key?

How would I run an executable test client against my server?

How do I fix the 401 unauthorized error?
